It features vocals from fellow rappers Proof, Mr. Porter, Eye-Kyu, Three and Thyme. The album sold only about 1,000 copies, and received rare reviews, which were mixed, mainly criticizing the album's production but praising Eminem's lyrical ability. Copies of the album are generally valued at $130–$200 due to the rarity and low production of the album. While Eminem's future albums would prove more successful, the rapper still gained some recognition for his debut effort."
